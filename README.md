# Tic Tac Toe
This repository is for the self project done by me in Spring '24.

First run 'python3 game.py' 

You can run play_tictactoe.py as follows and play against your computed policies by 'game.py'. 
NOTE: This requires pygame package.

'python3 play_tictactoe.py --BotPlayer x --BotStrategyFile policy_x.json' -> Playing as 'o'

or

'python3 play_tictactoe.py --BotPlayer o --BotStrategyFile policy_o.json' -> Playing as 'x'
