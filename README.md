# Tic Tac Toe
This repository is for the self project done by me in Spring '24.

You can run play_tictactoe.py as follows and play against the computed policies by `game.py`. 

> Note: This requires pygame package.

Commands to run:

```
python3 game.py
python3 play_tictactoe.py --BotPlayer x --BotStrategyFile policy_x.json -> for playing as 'o'
python3 play_tictactoe.py --BotPlayer o --BotStrategyFile policy_o.json -> for playing as 'x'
```
